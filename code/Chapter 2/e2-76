; new types may be needed:
;		generic operations with explicit dispatch -- add new clause to explicit dispatch
;		data-directed style -- nothing
;		message-passing-style -- nothing

; new operations may be needed:
;		generic operations with explicit dispatch -- change each clause
;		data-directed style -- add new install procedure
;		message-passing-style -- add new dispatch procedure

;		last two style is better in two situations, I think.


; For generic operations with explicit dispatch, whenever a new type is added, procedures for every generic operations need to be written and all of the existing procedures need to be modified to include the dispatch on the new type. Whenever a new operation is written every procedure must be modified to include dispatch on the new operation too.
; For data-directed systems, whenever a new type is added, one procedure for each operation must be written and installed into the operations table. Whenever a new operation is needed, one procedure for each data type must be written to perform the operation and installed into the generic systemd too. The data-directed deriv procedure for example didn't need to be modified when adding exponentiation.

;;Message-passing is similar to data-directed in that adding a new data type needs a new dispatch procedure that implements all of the operations and when a new operation is added each data type must alter its own dispatch procedure to dispatch on and perform the new operation.
