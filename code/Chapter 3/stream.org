* Stream
*** what?
An alternative approach to modeling state, based on data structure called streams.
**** drawback
question of modular and more easily maintainded systems
**** good feature
avoid the drawbacks inherent in introducing assignment.
*** why?
As we shall see, streams can mitigate some of the complexity of modeling state.
Must we make the model change with time in order to model phenomena in a changing world? Think about
the issue in terms of mathmatical functions. We can describe the time-varying behavior of a quantity
x as a function of time x(t). If we concentrate on x instant by instant, we think of it as a chang-ing
quantity. Yet if we concentrate on the entire time history of values, we do not emphasize change-their
function itself does not change

*** how?
**** *delayed evaluation*
* Streams Are Delayed Lists

* Implement delay and force
* Infinite Streams
* Exloiting the Stream Paradigm
